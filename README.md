# About the App
This program is a task database allowing users to request and upload information to/from a server. The app will enable users to add tasks in the add new task form accessible via each categorization (category/projects). The user can see the tasks in the task component. The categories are displayed as a side navigation bar, which directs the user to more information about the selected category. This app renders only one index.html file in which different components are mounted and unmounted depending on the user's activity. Having one HTML file allows for a more reactive app and smooth transitions.
